							<span class="person-bio"> I am in my last year of mechanical engineering at Memorial, with a focus on biomedical engineering. I have a huge interest in additive manufacturing, healthcare, and technology, and how they interact with each other. At PolyUnity, I have developed medical simulation models for teaching procedures, designed various novel products, as well as created replacement parts to help supply staff with the parts they need to avoid supply chain issues. </span>

								<span class="person-title"> Director, People & Resource Evolution (K&D Pratt Group Inc.) </span>
							</div>
							<span class="person-bio"> I believe people are THE resource that drives organizational success. For over two decades, I have translated that belief into action, leading human resource teams who deliver meaningful HR and employee relations programs to deliver desired organizational outcomes. My approach starts with understanding how the business operates (and let's be honest, how it really works is not necessarily as described in the company manual). I then engage leaders and team members at all levels and link human resource and employee relations service delivery to the business needs. From developing the people strategy for new markets and redesigning organizational structures to support service delivery that integrates acquisitions across multiple geographies, implementing new pan-organizational technologies to negotiating agreements that enable operational efficiencies, my approach has proven success – demonstrated in relevant, measurable business results. </span>

								<span class="person-name"> Steph McIntyre </span>
								<span class="person-title"> Instructional Assistant (Memorial University of Newfoundland) </span>
							</div>
							<span class="person-bio"> Steph McIntyre sat at their computer, staring blankly at the screen. They had been asked to provide a bio for Hackfrost 2023, but they were struggling to come up with anything interesting to say. As a Full-time Instructional Assistant and Per-Course Instructor in the Computer Science department at Memorial University, Steph was used to explaining complex ideas to their students, but when it came to writing about themselves, they were at a loss.
								<br /><br /> After several hours of staring at the same blank page, Steph decided to try something different. They turned to a chatbot that promised to help generate content for their bio. Skeptical at first, Steph was surprised to find that the chatbot was actually quite helpful. It asked them a series of questions about their areas of interest, such as logic, databases, and photography, and used the answers to craft a unique and compelling bio.
								<br /><br /> Feeling relieved and grateful for the chatbot's assistance, Steph submitted the bio to the organizers of Hackfrost 2023. Although they couldn't take all the credit for the final product, Steph was proud to have found a solution to their problem and excited to see how their bio would be received by the community at the upcoming event.</span>
