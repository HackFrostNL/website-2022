As a Full-time Instructional Assistant and Per-Course Instructor in the Computer Science department at Memorial University, Steph was used to explaining complex ideas to their students, but when it came to writing about themselves, they were at a loss.<br /><br /> After several hours of staring at the same blank page, Steph decided to try something different. They turned to a chatbot that promised to help generate content for their bio. Skeptical at first, Steph was surprised to find that the chatbot was actually quite helpful. It asked them a series of questions about their areas of interest, such as logic, databases, and photography, and used the answers to craft a unique and compelling bio.<br /><br /> Feeling relieved and grateful for the chatbot's assistance, Steph submitted the bio to the organizers of Hackfrost 2023. Although they couldn't take all the credit for the final product, Steph was proud to have found a solution to their problem and excited to see how their bio would be received by the community at the upcoming event.",
